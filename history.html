                        We're just a group of friends that really enjoy old multi-player games, and came together to
                        create
                        a community focused on that!
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        Our main goal, as a community and entity, is to host classic game servers and gamemodes that
                        everyone liked, and that in our
                        times are
                        decaying or lacking of hosted servers to play on, yet, this didn't start from one day to
                        another.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The idea of this community all started one day, 5 years ago, in a LAN party, where Jawiscript
                        was playing one of his favorite old school games "<i>Dark Messiah</i>", he and Frenzoid talked
                        about how sad
                        it was that
                        some games that we enjoyed a lot, and had multiplayed, didn't had any servers to play on, after
                        that, the idea wasn't brought back until a few years in the future, in a teamspeak3 call where
                        we talked about it more thoroughly, we talked and tought how nice it could be to make a
                        community dedicated to hosting old school game servers, yet, at that time we didn't had the
                        means to start such project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        A few years later after that, a TF2 FF2 player called Nezzi was getting tired of the servers
                        they were playing in, the server in specific had bad admins, and oftenly abused their powers.
                        After a time, Nezzi and Frenzoid met, and started planning to host their own TF2 FF2 server,
                        where they could not only have the same experience, but also improve it from what they learned
                        in the previous servers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        After a few weeks of research and VPS tinkering, our first server was up! And thus gave the
                        start to this community, OldBox.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        And from there on, we just keept growing, trying to host game servers that are not only
                        considered classic by the standards of today, but also that would have others enjoy their
                        gameplay.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Hosting, as for today, requires quite a monetary expense, and the number of servers that we host
                        are quite limtied because of this, we want to make sure that if we are hosting a server people
                        will actually play on it, but we strive for the future, to one day have many members and thus,
                        make the expense worth!
